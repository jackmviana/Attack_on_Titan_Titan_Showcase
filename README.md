## Description

Welcome to the Titan Showcase! There are buttons for 5 charcters and their corresponding Titan button, these will display information about each. This is the place to get familiar with each character and their titan, and showcase them all in one place. The Titan Showcase is sourcing information from an Attack on Titan API, and paired with information from the Attack on Titan wiki (both links in the credits below) to provide an informative page about your favorite shifters!

## Getting Started

Click each button to get information and details about a character and their Titan! The Titan button also features an image showing the scale of the Titan compared to their human form. Just make sure you look closely or you'll miss it.

## Charcter and Titan Information

Each character will have their information displayed on the left side of the screen. This contains their name, height, gender, a bio, and first appearance episode. The characters image will also appear in the center of the screen. For the titans, their information will display on the right side of the screen. This contains their name, height, bio, some abilites, and also their first appearance episode. Their image will also appear in the center of the screen, showing the scale of the titan and human form together!
