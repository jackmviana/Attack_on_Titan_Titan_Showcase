# The Marvel Legends Gallery

## The Purpose
A Gallery of Marvel's greatest heroes, showcased all in one place. Select a hero to dsiplay their image, alongside them are their description, abilities, and some of their most noteworthy comic book appearances! 

## The Vision
The page serves as an homage to Marvel's Legends, to reflect that, its packaged in a smooth and minimal user experience. Sleek modern designs, with animations for the Legend's selecter carousel, animations for the images and side panels, sitting flush on a minmalistic site that is user friendly.

## The Functionality

## Marvel API
The Marvel's Legends Gallery couldn't have been made possible without the extensive API provided for free. It is where we pull our data from to bring knowledge and life to the gallery. Paired with javascript, the gallery is able to seamlessly display information for the user, even directly providing the API link for them. Marvel allowed for this to be possible, so we are providing the resource to others! With access to all of this information, we selected the fundamentals for each Legend, being informative and concise. 

## Getting Started
After wireframing, whiteboarding, and planning with the Trello board, I'll lay down the basic HTML code for the page. This includes the top nav bar, marvels logo, a sign in button (which wont function but are just to make a blueprint/illusion). Then layout a flex box/grid to have the images of the heroes appear in the center on the page, being the main attraction. To the right will be a section for the heroes "card", with details about each individual hero. Below that will be a carousel that can be shuffled horizontally, with the selected heroes name displaying in the center and highlighted. Buttons for each hero. Animations will be attempted for the carousel, and for the images and "cards" as you scroll through the carousel. I want to implement something that highlights the heroes image, like a spotlight or glow. Mainly, I will use what we learned when creating the Pokedex and use it as a starting point for this project. Using fetch to link the url from the heroes section of the API, one for each hero. Then use .then to target the information I want to include.
